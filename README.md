To upload the defualt samples into the serial flash, use the "upload x.in" in order, then uplad delaydelus_v29.ino. This is the easiest, hackiest way of getting data into the s25_fl without some kind of complicated serial communication.<br>
<br>
If you're just wanting the newest version, only upload delaydelus_v29.ino. 

You'll need the older version of bounce for any of this to work.
The hex file is included in case you need to go back to factory setting without messing with old libraries.

To upload the default samples into the serial flash, use the "upload x.in" in order, then upload delaydelus_v29.ino. This is the easiest, hackiest way of getting data into the s25_fl without some kind of complicated serial communication.<br>
<br>
If you're just wanting the newest version, only upload delaydelus_v29.ino. 
<br>
You'll need the older version of bounce for any of this to work.<br>
The hex file is included in case you need to go back to factory setting without messing with old libraries.
